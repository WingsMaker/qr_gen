# qr_gen
Wrote my own webapp for QR code generator. No need internet access, clean codes.
Can be used for those company laptop with restricted access.

Background
           Today we still use public website webqr.com or etc to creeate QR via public internet.
           Better way for company laptop is to use in-house webapp ( with no access to outside world  )

It can be also be used for internet isolated machines, as well as personal PC.

How to install?
- creates a folder "qr_gen" in your desktop, download the 4 files ( .html and .js ) into it.
- just open the html file using your internet browser.

For laptop with camera, use **qrscan.html** to scan QR code.
For non-camera laptop, use **qr_import.html**
